# DevOps 30 Day Challenge
This repository is created to consolidate all of the projects for the 30 day challenge. The 30 day challenge can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ifeanyi-otuonye_cloud-cloudengineer-cloudcomputing-activity-7279481398208462850-lzkO?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

There will be a directory for each day of the challenge. The following must be present in each directory:
 - *Readme.md* - file that contains instructions for implementing the individual project, reference to the architecture diagram, and to the video for the challenge.
 - *Terraform template(s)* - file(s) to deploy all required resources for the project.
 - *Architecture Diagram* - Visual representation of the implemented services/resources for the project.

 The intent is to maintain a repository showcasing individual projects implemented in line with the challenge.
